# DCPU16 C compiler

This is a horrible c compiler targeting the DCPU16 

The reason I am creating this compiler is so I can eventually use it to write
some simple OS for the DCPU16, and because I like C and I can't find anything 
that I can port easily I will just create my own :shrug:

## Working
* Functions
* Variables (must be declared at start of function)
* Most binary operators 
* Basic type checking
* if and else
* return
* pointers
* casts

## TODO
* Function calls
* Structs, Enums and Unions
* Global variables
* Logical, Relational and Equality operators
* Multiple compilation units
